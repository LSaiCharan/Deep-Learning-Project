# Deep Learning Project
This Repository contains the project "Detection and Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) level in a Specific City using Deep Learning".

This project proposes a novel approach for detecting and predicting air pollution
levels in a specific city using deep learning and Air Quality Index (AQI). The
method employs a RNN-LSTM Model to analyze historical air quality data,
including AQI, from multiple sources, such as meteorological and air quality
sensors. The RNN-LSTM model is a deep learning technique that can model
sequential data and capture temporal dependencies between inputs. The
architecture of the proposed model includes an input layer, multiple hidden
LSTM layers, and an output layer. The model is trained using backpropagation
through time (BPTT) algorithm and optimized with an appropriate loss function.
The RNN-LSTM model is trained on this historical data to forecast future air
pollution levels with high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and predicting air pollution
levels based on AQI in the chosen city. The project highlights the importance of
using AQI as an effective measure of air pollution and leveraging deep learning
techniques to tackle this critical environmental issue. The study offers a
promising solution to the problem and presents an opportunity for wider
application of this method in environmental monitoring and management.
